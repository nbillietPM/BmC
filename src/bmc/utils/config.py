    """
    Safely loads, resolves, and validates a YAML execution recipe.

    This utility parses a configuration text file into a native Python dictionary,
    enforces structural schema requirements, and translates relative path paths
    into absolute system paths to prevent downstream tracking failures.

    Parameters
    ----------
    yaml_path : str
        The absolute or relative file system path to the target .yaml recipe file.
    logger : logging.Logger, optional
        An active Python logger instance to capture validation events. If None, 
        fallback logging will default to the file's internal module-level logger.
        Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        The fully loaded, verified, and path-resolved configuration dictionary.

    Raises
    ------
    FileNotFoundError
        If the specified YAML configuration file does not exist on disk.
    ValueError
        If critical top-level keys ('base_dir' or 'spatial') are missing from the file.
