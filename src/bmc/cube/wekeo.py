class wekeo_cube(spatiotemporal_cube):
    """
    Orchestration layer for processing WEkEO (Copernicus Land Monitoring Service) Earth Observation data.

    This class acts as a specialized data cube generator inheriting from `spatiotemporal_cube`. 
    It bridges the gap between abstract user configurations defined in a YAML recipe and the 
    physical operations required to fetch, align, and reconstruct multi-dimensional data cubes 
    from the WEkEO STAC catalog. It introduces a critical metadata "smuggling" technique 
    to preserve complex categorical attributes through out-of-core GDAL C++ warping processes.

    Attributes
    ----------
    dataset_resolution_strategy : str or None
        The resolution override strategy (e.g., "highest", "lowest", or a specific metric 
        like "10m") extracted from the WEkEO YAML configuration during plan generation. 
        Utilized during grid resolution to dynamically select the correct target grid.

    Methods
    -------
    generate_execution_plan(recipe, logger, catalog_path_override=None)
        Intersects YAML spatiotemporal constraints against a GeoParquet STAC catalog 
        to generate a standardized asset fetching queue.
    resolve_target_grid(spatial_cfg, logger)
        Resolves dynamic target resolutions against the global configuration and strictly 
        validates them against the core engine's grid registry.
    parse_metadata(row, da)
        Injects temporal axes, sanitizes redundant spatial dimensions, and structurally encodes 
        categorical metadata into the variable's string name before GDAL processing.
    get_resample_rule(variable_name)
        Decodes the structurally smuggled variable name to determine the mathematically safe 
        GDAL resampling algorithm.
    apply_multi_index(level, dataset)
        Unpacks the smuggled string metadata post-warp and expands the flattened variables 
        back into a formalized N-dimensional data cube.

    Notes
    -----
    The underlying GDAL C++ bindings inherently strip Python `xarray` coordinates during 
    spatial affine reprojection. To circumvent this, the `wekeo_cube` encodes metadata 
    (such as `aggregation` and `layer_class`) directly into the `DataArray` name string 
    using a double-underscore delimiter (`__`) in `parse_metadata`. 
    This string safely passes through GDAL, and is subsequently split apart by 
    `apply_multi_index` to restore the correct dimensions.

        """
        Translates the YAML execution recipe into a standardized data fetching queue by 
        intersecting user constraints against the WEkEO GeoParquet database.

        This method acts as the primary translation layer between the abstract user request 
        (e.g., "Give me Grassland data for 2018") and the physical data lake. It loads 
        the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) stored as a GeoParquet file, parses the 
        requested variables and temporal bounds from the recipe, and applies highly 
        optimized Pandas boolean masking to filter out irrelevant files. The result is 
        a flat, standardized execution queue ready for out-of-core parallel downloading 
        and spatial warping.

        Parameters
        ----------
        recipe : Dict[str, Any]
            The fully loaded and parsed YAML configuration dictionary. Must contain the 
            'sources' and 'temporal' schema blocks to dictate the spatiotemporal bounds 
            and requested specific variables.
        logger : logging.Logger
            The active logger instance used to record catalog intersection progress, 
            connection/loading status, and the final extracted asset queue count.
        catalog_path_override : Optional[str], default=None
            A direct absolute or relative path to the GeoParquet STAC catalog. If provided, 
            this explicitly overrides both the path specified in the YAML recipe and the 
            hardcoded system default.

        Returns
        -------
        pd.DataFrame
            A standardized execution queue containing the exact physical assets to be processed. 
            The DataFrame contains the following enforced columns:
            - `level` (str): The processing family or collection group (e.g., 'GRA').
            - `variable` (str): The core scientific variable name (e.g., 'Grassland').
            - `year` (int): The temporal year of the specific data slice.
            - `aggregation` (str): The mathematical representation (e.g., 'coverage', 'max').
            - `layer_class` (str): The categorical class label, if applicable.
            - `vsi_path` (str): The direct file path or Virtual File System (VSI) URL to the GeoTIFF.
            
            Returns an empty DataFrame if no assets match the constraints or if the 
            catalog file is missing/corrupted.

        -----
        The method executes in five distinct phases:
        1. Hierarchy of path resolution (Override -> Recipe -> Default).
        2. Configuration extraction and temporal bounding.
        3. Vectorized Pandas boolean mask generation.
        4. Asset URL extraction and queue standardization.
        5. Finalization and DataFrame construction.

        """
        Determines the appropriate GDAL spatial resampling algorithm by decoding 
        the structurally smuggled routing name.

        During out-of-core affine reprojection, different physical and ecological 
        variables require strictly different mathematical algorithms to prevent 
        data corruption. Because standard GDAL C++ bindings strip away 
        complex xarray coordinates, the `parse_metadata` method previously encoded 
        the requested aggregation strategy directly into the variable's string name 
        (e.g., "Forest_Type__coverage__Broadleaved_forest"). 
        
        This method acts as the decoder ring, splitting that string, extracting the 
        user's requested aggregation, and safely translating it into an exact GDAL 
        resampler keyword compatible with the parent spatial engine.

        Parameters
        ----------
        variable_name : str
            The heavily encoded variable name containing the scientific variable, 
            the aggregation method, and the class label separated by double underscores 
            (e.g., "Tree_Cover_Density__max__unknown").

        Returns
        -------
        str
            The strictly validated GDAL resampling string used for out-of-core warping. 
            Returns "average" for fractional coverages, the direct statistical string 
            for continuous variables (e.g., "max"), or safely falls back to "nearest" 
            if the string is improperly formatted.

        Executes post-warp dimensionality reduction and reconstructs the finalized multi-dimensional data cube.

        Because the core spatial engine relies on GDAL C++ bindings for out-of-core affine 
        reprojection, any complex multidimensional structures (like specific class categories 
        or aggregation strategies) are flattened into independent 2D/3D variables.
